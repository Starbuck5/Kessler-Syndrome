# Kessler-Syndrome
Just a project my friend and I are working on.

Game idea:
Protagonist framed for crimes on Earth, exiled to space to collect orbital debris.
Protagonist becomes powerful by salvaging peices of old satellites, eventually confronting his framer (President of the World)
in a boss battle. 

Called "Kessler Syndrome" or just "Kessler"
Dystopian future where the Earth can't launch things into space because it is too risky
Strange offshoots of humanity/ cults / aliens threaten anything that leaves the surface as well
Thats why they send some convicted criminals up there to clean it up before they are struck by debris
You have to collect or they will shoot down your ship with a ground based missile
Why can't they use robots to clean up? They could, but they prefer to punish people... b/c totalitarian government
